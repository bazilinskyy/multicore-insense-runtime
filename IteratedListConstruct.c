/*
 * IteratedList.c
 * Implementation of a singly linked list of pointers (void *)
 * which allows insertion (at head), removal of specific 
 * nodes idetified by value, and iterated access to elements in the list
 *
 * Coded to contain void* pointers in case we want to use the list for
 * for a variety of objects.
 *
 * As list node structures are not contained in more than one list at present,
 * memory for nodes is maintained manually and not garbage collected.
 * In contrast, memory for the node payload and list object (containing 
 * pointer to first and next elements in iterated list) is garbage collected.
 * The payload of nodes may be any object for which memory is allocated by
 * DAL_alloc. The payload may be contained by many lists, for example, 
 * a single channel may be referenced by many connections lists.
 * The decRef function for the list is called by DAL_decRef (garbage collector)
 * before freeing memory for the list object when the ref count for a list 
 * object reaches zero. The decRef function simply removes all list nodes,
 * explicitly freeing memory used by list nodes after decrementing the ref 
 * count for all elements referenced by the list nodes.
