/* 
 * events.h
 *
 * Definitnion of integer values used by the system to indicate 
 * 
 *  - channel success or failure internally to InceOS
 *  - radio (INCH) communication events (yet to be implemeted) 
 *  - success (operation succeeded, the procedure returned inidcating ok, ...) 
 *  - the occurrence of exceptions 
 *
 * GENERAL_SUCCESS_EVENT indicates succeess, e.g. the operation succeeded, the procedure returned normally (no exception thrown)
 * The first exception is at 1+GENERAL_SUCCESS_EVENT and all other exceptions follow.
